<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This is not intended to be complete. Just a collection of starting
points for further exploration.</p>
<p>I'm not putting it here but you should look at PySolFC for card
games.</p>
<h1 id="game-engines">Game Engines</h1>
<h2 id="chess-type-game-engines">Chess Type Game Engines</h2>
<h3 id="fairy-stockfish">Fairy Stockfish</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish">GitHub -
fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish</a></p>
<p>Fairy-Stockfish is a chess variant engine derived from Stockfish
designed for the support of fairy chess variants and easy extensibility
with more games. It can play various regional, historical, and modern
chess variants as well as games with user-defined rules. For
compatibility with graphical user interfaces it supports the UCI, UCCI,
USI, UCI-cyclone, and CECP/XBoard protocols.</p>
<h3 id="sjaak">Sjaak</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.eglebbk.dds.nl/program/chess-index.html">Chess
(Jazz &amp; Sjaak) home</a></p>
<p>Welcome to the homepage dedicated to my expanding family of chess
engines: Jazz, Sjaak and Leonidas!</p>
<p>Jazz is a fairly standard chess program. It currently has no opening
book, and doesn't use an endgame database.</p>
<p>Sjaak is a much weaker chess program (Sjaak II less so than the old
version), but in addition to normal chess it can play a (large) number
of other games and chess variants.</p>
<p>Leonidas is intermediate between Jazz and Sjaak and was designed
primarily to play Spartan Chess (see below), but it plays some more
variants.</p>
<h1 id="multi-game-frontends">Multi-game Frontends</h1>
<h2 id="liground">liground</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ml-research/liground">GitHub -
ml-research/liground: A free, open-source and modern Chess Variant
Analysis GUI for the 21st century</a></p>
<p>LiGround is a modern cross-platform chess variant GUI. It supports
all lichess variants, as well as all major regional variants (Xiangqi,
Shogi, Janggi, Makruk). Since the project still is rather new, it is not
as feature rich as the other GUIs yet. Precompiled versions for each OS
can be downloaded from the releases.</p>
<p>Its game logic uses the Fairy-Stockfish based ffishjs library,
therefore it is very well compatible with Fairy-Stockfish.</p>
<p>LiGround ships with preincluded engine binaries. By default all
engines are downloaded automatically into the ./engines/ folder as
postinstall action.</p>

<p>Welcome to the Ludii Portal!</p>
<p>Ludii is a general game system designed to play, evaluate and design
a wide range of games, including board games, card games, dice games,
mathematical games, and so on. Download the Ludii player to explore our
ever-growing database of games, test your AI search algorithms, and
design your own games.</p>
<p>Games are described as structured sets of ludemes (units of
game-related information). This allows the full range of traditional
strategy games from around the world to be modelled in a single playable
database for the first time. Ludii is being developed as part of the
ERC-funded Digital Ludeme Project.</p>

<h2 id="gnu-backgammon">GNU Backgammon</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnubg/#downloading">GNU
Backgammon</a></p>
<p>GNU Backgammon (GNUbg) plays and analyzes backgammon games and
matches. It is able to play and analyze both money games and tournament
matches, evaluate and roll out positions, and more. Driven by a
command-line interface, it displays an ASCII rendering of a board on
text-only terminals, but also allows the user to play games and
manipulate positions with a graphical GTK+ interface. GNU Backgammon is
extensible on platforms which support Python.</p>

<p><a href="http://hgm.nubati.net/">WinBoard 4.7</a></p>
<p>A Graphical User Interface for Chess and its Variants</p>
<p>I have upgraded the popular Winboard GUI to be able to handle more
different piece types, and larger board sizes. I also improved the
support for variants with piece drops, such as Crazyhouse and
Bughouse.</p>
<p>In addition, I included various adjudication possibilities for
engine-engine games. WinBoard can now adjudicate theoretical draws,
award 50-move and repetition draws (after an adjustable number of moves
or repetitions), adjudicate trivial draws such as KBKB. It can also test
draw and win claims by the engines for validity. The move legality
testing is improved to the point where it should be 100% reliable, as
WinBoard now also keeps track of castling rights and en-passant
status.</p>
<p>WinBoard is now also aware of pieces occurring in Capablanca Chess
(ArchBishop and Chancellor), Shatranj (Alfil and Ferz), Xiangqi (Chinese
Chess) and Shogi (Japanese Chess), so that these games can also be
played with legality testing on. (Although the legality testing in the
latter two might be not as strict as with Western Chess.)</p>
