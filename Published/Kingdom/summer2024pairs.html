Tournament</h1>
<p><img src="./Pokemon%20Pairs%202024.png" alt="Poster" /> </p>
<h1 id="general-rules">General Rules</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Expanded deck selection. Play with what you’ve got.</p></li>
<li><p>Proxy cards allowed. Proxy cards must be backed with an actual
Pokémon card.</p></li>
<li><p>Decks must be viable for play. Final decision by judges.</p></li>
<li><p>All decks must consist of Pokémon cards that are viable for
gameplay. Each Pokémon included in the deck should be capable of
attacking, with exceptions for those that are primarily included for
their abilities. This ensures fair and balanced gameplay for all
participants.</p></li>
<li><p>Support Players: (players that are assisting others to play) Some
trainers may benefit from extra support to compete. A support player
counts as an entrant so can only enter once. They will be recorded as a
two player team. This is the stop the top player from competing against
themselves in the final rule.</p></li>
<li><p>Minor errors in game play that can be settled with an agreement
between players are allowed. Judges must still be informed. Once a judge
is involved in a rule discussion their decision is final.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="pokémon-pairs-rules">Pokémon Pairs Rules</h1>
<p>Expect these to be tweaked as we have more practice games</p>
<ul>
<li>Two players per team.</li>
<li>Proxy and Foreign Cards: Proxy cards and foreign language cards are
permitted in the tournament. However, players must provide a source of
what the card does in English to ensure that all participants can
understand the card’s effects by reading it. Proxy cards must be sleeved
and back by an official Pokémon card. This promotes inclusivity and
allows players to use cards from various sources.</li>
<li>Decks <em>can</em> be tweaked between sessions. Study your opponents
and learn their ways!</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="competition">Competition</h1>
<p>Final match(es) on <strong>Sep 28</strong>. Competition format will
depend on how many teams there are. Probably having as many team v. team
battles in the previous two weeks as we can then a final battle between
the two top teams.</p>
