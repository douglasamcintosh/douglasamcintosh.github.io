# Summer 2024 Pokémon Pairs Tournament

![Poster](./Pokemon%20Pairs%202024.png)\ 

# General Rules

 - Expanded deck selection. Play with what you've got.

 - Proxy cards allowed. Proxy cards must be backed with an actual Pokémon card.

 - Decks must be viable for play. Final decision by judges.

 - All decks must consist of Pokémon cards that are viable for gameplay. Each Pokémon included in the deck should be capable of attacking, with exceptions for those that are primarily included for their abilities. This ensures fair and balanced gameplay for all participants.

 - Support Players: (players that are assisting others to play) Some trainers may benefit from extra support to compete. A support player counts as an entrant so can only enter once. They will be recorded as a two player team. This is the stop the top player from competing against themselves in the final rule.

 - Minor errors in game play that can be settled with an agreement between players are allowed. Judges must still be informed. Once a judge is involved in a rule discussion their decision is final.

# Pokémon Pairs Rules

Expect these to be tweaked as we have more practice games

 - Two players per team.
 - Proxy and Foreign Cards: Proxy cards and foreign language cards are permitted in the tournament. However, players must provide a source of what the card does in English to ensure that all participants can understand the card's effects by reading it. Proxy cards must be sleeved and back by an official Pokémon card. This promotes inclusivity and allows players to use cards from various sources.
 - Decks *can* be tweaked between sessions. Study your opponents and learn their ways!


# Competition

Final match(es) on **Sep 28**. Competition format will depend on how many teams there are. Probably having as many team v. team battles in the previous two weeks as we can then a final battle between the two top teams.
