# Character Classes

## Basic Statistics

Should probably define what the basic statistics are.

[Basic stats](statistics.html)

## Universal Moves

Moves that should be common to all characters.

## Cops

There is probably a good argument that all the cop types should just be filed under cop and then allow players to select moves that fit.

Background moves can be used to allow more variation. For example a military or espionage background.

### Alpha Cop

A cowboy that doesn't play by the rules. Or maybe he does play by the rules if he is Judge Dredd. Traditionally male though this is more a matter of attitude than gender. 

### Analyst Cop

Someone that uses a more understated approach. Piecing the evidence together to work towards a conviction.

### The Driver

Someone needs to be good at the car stuff. Or bikes. Or stolen tanks from the nearby army base. If it can be driven, they can drive it.

## Dark Dundee Characters

### The Weird Scientist

The weird scientist can make things that won't work anywhere else. Things that are on the boundary between magic and science. Perhaps a camera that can take a picture of the last thing a person saw just before they died, a necrophone even reanimating the recently deceased, though this never ends well.

### Creature of the Night

A tortured soul trying to hang on to their humanity. A bloodsucker who feeds only on animals, a wolfen who flees to the wilderness once a month or even an inhabitant of the 'Smouth.'
