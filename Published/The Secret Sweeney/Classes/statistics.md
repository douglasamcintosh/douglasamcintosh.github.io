# Basic Statistics

Ummm. Yes?

## Physical

Strength, dexterity it's all here.

If you need a door kicked down or someone punched in the face, this is the statistic where it's at. 

Certain weapons may have a greater effect when used by a stronger character. 

This can also refer to dexterity and general fitness. Tests of agility and athleticism should be informed by this statistic. Long distance chase after a perp, jumping over a fence then followed by a punch up in a dark alley. You want this.

## Wits

Cleverness and sense.

This is a combination of innate intelligence and education. Analysing a crime scene, studying a suspect's body language this is the statistic that you want.

## Presence

Personality. Persuasion, intimidation and cajoling.

When you walk into a room every eye turns to look at you, conversation pauses and there is an expectant air. 

A long stare can reduce the toughest criminal to a quivering wreck, a kind smile can reduce them to tears of gratitude.

This is most useful against people and creatures closely allied with people. When being challenged by a Wastrel Wolfen perhaps a firm '*down boy*' will be enough to see you survive the night.

## Guts

Hunches, confidence.

They have a smooth talking criminal lawyer, alibis all the way down and there's no forensics â€¦ but you know they're guilty. Somehow you know just the question to ask to get under their skin.

The firefight has gone South. That thing you keep shooting refuses to lie down and the angles of the room don't add up any more.  Your colleagues are screaming, praying and throwing up. With a deep breath, brief curse, you stand up from behind the barricade and charge! Inspiring the others to follow.

## Resilience

Physical toughness.Take a lickin' and keep on tickin'.

Punches, bullets and even the staff canteen hold no fear for you.

## Weird

Connection to The Dark.
