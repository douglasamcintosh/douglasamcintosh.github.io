[Common Tropes](Tropes)

Commonly used tropes from 70s TV and inspirational horror. I'm really thinking more Clark Ashton Smith than Lovecraft. Like in The Beyond I never want the weird to be fully explained or bounded by anything like real world rules.

Do I want to add a conspiracy of assassins like in Killing Eve or John Wick?

Need to watch some American buddy cop stuff.
