<div class="Dedication">
This document references a more sexist and bigoted time. I can remember the day to day racism, bigotry, xenophobia and sexism that was not only tolerated but encouraged. It upsets me to this day that I engaged in any of it. Like any game the players should be clear about what is and is not acceptable at their table. All individuals should be comfortable not just most of them. Acceptance and tolerance should not be an average level of comfort but a minimum. Dark Dundee feeds on hate, fear and loathing. Don’t give it more.

All the cops should be fairly tough, able to hold their own in a fistfight, have basic firearms training and have a solid grounding in crime scene investigation. Every character has to be working for the police in some capacity. Every character also has to be either human, originally human or at the very least mostly human.<span class="Marginal">

In some places Innsmouth, Dunwich, Jackson, Brichester and Dundee something has occurred that has shattered the wall. There are paths between, ghost walks, Fey trails, dead end underpasses that allow travel between. Unreality seeps in and the real world location becomes a little more distant. These locations at as a magnet for the weird and wonderful attracting people and things with an interest in the mysteries of the world. Most people still don’t notice, a person’s ability to lie to themselves is significant. Seen a ghost; ’I’ve had too much to drink’. Nosferatu in the shadows; ’trick of the light’. Chilling sense of potential apocalypse under a blood moon; ’bit chilly tonight I’ll put the central heating on!’

For decades, there have been rumours about supposed black magic rituals being undertaken in well-known local sites such as Balgay hill, the Law, Ballumbie, Templeton Woods and Claypotts Castle, to name but a few. By day, these places appear tranquil and serene, but if the rumours are true, it’s a completely different world at night.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Dundee is no stranger to tales of the occult, and the vast array of local stories about fooling about with ouija boards and finding strange markings and evidence of rituals come across our desks more often than you could imagine – you lot are a strange bunch! Even Bonnie Dundee, Bloody Clavers himself, is reported to have made a deal with the devil to make him more robust in battle (although we all know how that worked out for him in the end). Black magic, worship of the devil and dark occultism have been around for millennia. Before science took a grip of the world, almost everyone believed in some form of higher power and the practise of witchcraft in some form or another. People engaged with each other by telling stories, and, as the story passed from person to person, it became more embellished and elaborate – a trait which is still dominant in us to this day. There is very little in the way of documented evidence showing demonic invocation, possession, necromancy, or even the healing powers of white magic, yet still it is a touchy subject for most of us.

</div>
<div class="Indented">
A man lived with his nine, reportedly beautiful daughters on farmland known as Pitempton. After a particularly busy day tending the land on what had turned out to be a very warm day, the farmer felt that his insatiable thirst could only be quenched by a pail of water fetched from a nearby well. Having been so tired from his day of labouring, he entrusted his eldest daughter to the task.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
As time passed, and with no sign of his eldest daughter, the father sent the second-eldest daughter to find out what was taking so long and prolonging his thirst. Once again, when his second daughter did not return, he sent the third-eldest daughter. When she did not return either, he sent the next in line. This continued until he had sent each and every one of the sisters after each other, despite nobody ever returning. Eventually, the farmer decided he should go and see what had delayed his daughters. By this time, he must have been so thirsty and tired that the walk to the well would have taken up most of his energy.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Imagine his horror, when, upon reaching the well, he saw the nine slain bodies of his lovely daughters strewn over the ground by the well! Coiled around their battered bodies, basking in the blood of the innocent victims, the farmer was aghast to see a huge serpent-like dragon. Fearing he was about to become the tenth kill of the evening for the furious beast, the farmer fled screaming and shouting.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Disturbed by all the commotion, a crowd of neighbours had gathered as the farmer calmed down enough to tell them what he had seen near the well by Pitempton. Although they were scared, the people were also maddened by the deaths of the nine maidens, so they armed themselves with anything they could use as a weapon and set off to slay the dragon. It is said that Martin, a man of “brave heart and tremendous skill and courage” led the angry crowd back to the well to engage the beast. Martin is also referenced as the lover of one of the felled beauties, which may explain his heroism in the forthcoming battle.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Perhaps sensing that it was no match for the baying mob, the dragon attempted to make it’s escape, over the Dighty and into the lands beyond. Martin, however, had other ideas, and caught up with it. Using only a wooden club, he beat the dragon, eventually slaying it as the crowd yelled “strike, Martin”. Incidentally, the place where the dragon was defeated was named “Strike-Martin”, and was subsequently named Strathmartine – a name which has been used as titles for streets and buildings in the city.

The legend, or fairy tale of Whuppity Stoorie reads a lot like a Scottish version of Rumplestiltskin. The story is said to have taken place in a wee place called Kittlerumpit – good luck finding an exact location on that place! Robert Chalmers writes of Whuppity Stoorie in his 1858 ‘Popular rhymes of Scotland’, regaling us with a tale of a bereft mother and a fairy with a wicked plot, whose name would eventually become her undoing. We’ll let you do the reading for yourself on this one…and if anyone can shed any light on the location of Kittlerumpit, please get in touch! … (follow the link)

</div>
<div class="Indented">
The tale of Alexander Lindsay, the 4th Earl of Crawford is by far one of the most popular ghost stories of Glamis. Known as “Earl Beardie”, Alexander Lindsay is alleged to have been a cruel, evil man with a wicked temperament and a searing bloodlust. Born to nobility and of a particularly influential character, he was involved in the battles against King James II as part of the Douglas clan uprisings. As we mentioned, he was an evil man, and it is alleged that he once had a black house-servant stripped naked and forced to run around in the grounds for his and the other Earls’ entertainment. In a macabre twist, the ‘entertainment’ was actually a hunt, and the poor man was chased down by Earl Beardie, his guests, and their hunting dogs. His screams rang out over the land as he was stabbed with spears and literally torn apart by the dogs, defenceless and stricken by mortal fear.

<a class="URL" href="www.ddtours.co.uk/archive/denfiend/">www.ddtours.co.uk/archive/denfiend/</a>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
During the 15th century, a family of cannibals are alleged to have lived on the outskirts of Dundee, in a place which came to be known as ‘Fiends Den’; later to be known as ‘Denfiend’ or ‘The Den of Fiends’. The location of Denfiend is said to be at a dip in the road between Newbigging and Monikie, just by the aptly-named Denfind Farm.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The legend goes that the family would lure in or ambush passers-by before murdering and eating them. No-one was safe from the voracious appetites of the cannibalistic family of Denfiend, but it is said that they preferred their victims young, as the meat was more succulent and tender. Initially the family never aroused suspicion, careful who they chose for their next meal so as not to cause any alarm, but, as time went on, their appetite for younger prey proved to be their downfall.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
With a lack of travellers to the area, the family looked to their neighbours for their next meal, causing a significant swell in locals being reported as missing. It did not take long for the family to be held to account for their crimes, and they were all swiftly executed, with the exception of the youngest daughter, who was merely a baby.

The song ‘Bonnie Susie Cleland’ is an interesting one. Adapted from The Child Ballads “Lady Maisry”, which tells a particularly brutal tale of a young Scots woman being burned at the stake by her family for falling in love with an English lord. Bonnie Susie Cleland is an adaptation of this tale set in Dundee, with Susie Cleland meeting a similar fate.

</div>
<div class="Indented">
One of the most famous legends associated with Glamis Castle is that of the ‘Monster of Glamis’; a child born to the family and so hideously disfigured he was isolated in secret chambers within the castle walls, which were sealed upon his death. Legend has its beginnings in 1821 when the first son of the eleventh Earl is said to have been born horribly malformed. To hide this anomaly, news of the child’s death was fabricated to ensure that no-one sought after him. Only those with the hereditary right to be informed are told of the secret upon reaching their 21st birthday.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Another spin on it is that, to each generation of the family, a vampire child (or a child of monstrously superior abilities) is born and must be walled up in the secret chamber.

In the latter part of 1882 and into the first few months of 1883, Dundee had a somewhat alarming visitor “…described as being rather tall, and is generally seen dressed in a long dark cloak, although occasionally he sometimes assumes a luminous appearance, supposed to be due to the inside of the cloak being lined with cloth dipped in phosphorus, and exposed to view. Several yards of crape are also suspended from his hat…” This dark, mysterious figure began appearing in and around the Blackness Quarry area around December 1882, and continued into February of the following year. Reports of the way he walked, or was able to leap in huge bounds earned him the popular moniker, “Springheels”. The situation became so phenomenal in the city, that stories of alleged sightings were ten a penny, with almost everyone knowing someone who had seen “Springheels”.

Let’s go back to 1816, when Princess Charlotte, daughter of the soon-to-be King George IV, became married to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (later King of the Belgians). News of a pregnancy soon followed – an heir to the throne – but it was quickly cut short when Princess Charlotte gave birth to a stillborn male and tragically died the following day in November 1817, aged just 21. This dark sequence of events has been written in the history books as occurring at Claremont House in England, but here’s where the twist comes in…

Local Dundee legend has it that Princess Charlotte and Prince Leopold were not at Claremont, as the story suggests, but were, in fact returning from a trip to Leopold’s homeland of Belgium when a mighty storm took hold of their ship. With their lives in perceived mortal danger, and with Princess Charlotte heavily pregnant, they sought refuge in the Tay in the hope of waiting out the terrible weather, and ended up in Broughty Ferry.

Unfortunately, the situation had proven too stressful for Charlotte and she began to go into labour. Getting her onto land would have proved difficult at best, but it is alleged they alighted at West Broughty Ferry and managed to secure lodgings at a nearby cottage where Charlotte gave birth and subsequently died. If Charlotte and Leopold’s child had survived, Queen Victoria would never have risen to the throne, and history as we now know it would be completely different.

The first incident took place during the day when I was sent out to get the newspapers that got delivered to the neighbours at the bottom of the road. I was with the dog and we were coming down the path that leads to the track running past the bottom of the property and out to the farm road. I have marked where I was walking with the yellow dots. Just before I got onto the track the dog stopped suddenly and started to growl, whine and bare her teeth, I remember seeing the hair rising on her back but I carried on past her for a few paces ending up on the track (the green dot is where I stopped). I looked up to see a large black figure further along the track standing with its back to me (red dot number 1). It was reaching up to a branch on a tree at the side of the track and was tall, thick build with no neck and wide shoulders. I remember standing in shock for a second or two before screaming and turning to run back to the house , as I screamed it slowly started to turn round but I didn’t hang about to see its face. Needless to say my reports of seeing a monster were not taken seriously and dismissed as it probably being a neighbour. I can’t give an exact year but I was around 8/9 years old. This is an estimation as I remember drawing a picture of it in primary 5 at school, so that puts it around 1980/81 and I don’t have an exact time of year but the leaves were out on the trees so it would have been sometime between April/May and September.
