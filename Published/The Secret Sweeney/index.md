# The Secret Sweeney

This document references a more sexist and bigoted time. I can remember the day to day racism, bigotry, xenophobia and sexism that was not only tolerated but encouraged. It upsets me to this day that I engaged in any of it. 

Like any game the players should be clear about what is and is not acceptable at their table. All individuals should be comfortable not just most of them. Acceptance and tolerance should not be an average level of comfort but a minimum. 

Dark Dundee feeds on hate, fear and loathing. Don't give it more.
